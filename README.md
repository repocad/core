The core of RepoCad
===

RepoCad is a collaborative and modern design editor that uses the state of the art scripting language, 
[RepoScript](https://github.com/repocad/reposcript) to write design. Together with our library of drawings, this gives 
you a novel way to collaborate on designs with whoever you want. 

Read more on [our wiki documentation](https://github.com/repocad/core/wiki).

## The core repository
This repository is interesting for you if you'd like to integrate RepoCad in your website. In brief, the ''core'' 
integrates the RepoScript environment into a website. Among other places this is used in our website, but it might as
well be used by you!

## How to use RepoCad
RepoCad is best served on its website, [repocad.com](http://repocad.com). But if you feel adventurous this is all
open-source, so [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) all you want!.

Sometime in the future we'll be presenting a guide on how to integrate the service in your website. Until then, you're
more than welcome to write us an email if you have any questions!
